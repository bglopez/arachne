  To install Aracne, make sure you have Python 2.5 installed.  Then run this
command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

  This will install the the aracne Python package, the /usr/sbin/aracned script
used to execute the Aracne daemon and the /etc/init.d/aracned shell script that
starts and stops it, the default configuration files and the documentation
found in the distribution.  It also will create a few empty directories
required by the default configuration.
