  To install Arachne, make sure you have Python 2.5 and the Python bindings for
Xapian (provided by the python-xapian Debian package) installed.  Then run this
command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

  Although it is not a requirement, you should consider installing a DNS cache
server (such as the provided in the djbdns Debian package) in the host running
Arachne to speed up the DNS queries.
