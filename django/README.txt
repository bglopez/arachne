  This directory contains a Django project that can be used as a web interface
to query the Xapian index generated by the Arachne daemon.

  The arachnesite project should be installed in the same host running the
Arachne daemon since it needs access to the Xapian index.  Alternatively, you
can plug the arachneapp application into an existent Django project.  You
should setup the options related with Arachne in the settings.py file:
ARACHNE_DATABASE_DIR, ARACHNE_ROOT and ARACHNE_MEDIA_URL.  See the comments in
this file for a description of each option.
