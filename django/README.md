This directory contains a Django project that can be used as a web
interface to query the Xapian index generated by the Arachne daemon.

The `arachnesite` project should be installed in the same host running
the Arachne daemon, given that it needs access to the Xapian index.
Alternatively, you can plug the `arachneapp` application into an
existent Django project.

You should set the following Arachne-related options in the
`settings.py` file: `ARACHNE_DATABASE_DIR`, `ARACHNE_ROOT` and
`ARACHNE_MEDIA_URL`. See the comments in that file for a description
of each option.
