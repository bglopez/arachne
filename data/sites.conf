# Any section defines a site to be indexed.  The section title (text between
# the the []s) is the URL of the site.  You can define default values for all
# sites in an special [default] section.

# The values for time intervals can be an integer number of seconds or an
# integer number followed by one of the characters s, m, h, d (indicating
# seconds, minutes, hours, days respectively), or a series of such pairs that
# can be optionally separated by spaces.

# request.

# Time to wait before trying to retrieve the content of a directory if an error
# occurs in the last request.
error_dir_wait = 15m

# Once a directory is indexed it has to be regularly visited to keep the
# content updated.  The crawler will try to estimate the right time interval to
# wait before visiting a directory again based on the default value for the
# site.  The estimated value is guaranteed to be between the minimum and
# maximum values.
