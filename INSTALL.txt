  To install Arachne, make sure you have Python 2.5 and the Python bindings for
Xapian (provided by the python-xapian Debian/Ubuntu package) installed.  Then
run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

  Although it is not a requirement, you should consider installing a DNS cache
server (such as the provided in the djbdns or pdnsd Debian/Ubuntu packages) in
the host running Arachne to speed up the DNS queries.

  See django/README.txt for instructions installing the Django application for
  Arachne.
