  To install Arachne, make sure you have Python 2.5 and the Python bindings for
Xapian (provided by the python-xapian Debian/Ubuntu package) installed.  Then
run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

  Although it is not a requirement, you should consider installing a DNS cache
server (such as the provided in the djbdns or pdnsd Debian/Ubuntu packages) in
the host running Arachne to speed up the DNS queries.

  You should also install (in the same host running the Arachne daemon) the web
interface provided by the Django project located in the django directory.  For
instructions installing a Django application refer to the Django Website.  You
should carefully setup the options in the settings.py file, especially
DATABASE_DIR, SITE_ROOT and MEDIA_URL (see the comments in the file for a
description).
